# 🧘‍♂️ Meditation App

A minimalist meditation timer built to help users focus, relax, and practice mindfulness through timed sessions and breathing exercises.

## 📜 Background

Originally built in 2021 as one of my first JavaScript projects. In 2024, I revisited the app to improve code structure, organization, and overall presentation as part of a personal portfolio refresh.

This project reflects my early learning journey — and my commitment to revisiting, refactoring, and continuously improving what I build.
