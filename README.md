A minimalist meditation timer built to help users focus, relax, and practice mindfulness through timed sessions and breathing exercises.

## 📜 Project Background

Originally created in 2022 (**v1**) as one of my first JavaScript projects. In 2025, I revisited the codebase and released **v2**, improving:

- Code structure and readability
- UI polish and mobile responsiveness
- Overall presentation and maintainability

This project reflects both where I started — and how far I’ve come. It’s a living snapshot of my growth mindset and commitment to continuous improvement.
