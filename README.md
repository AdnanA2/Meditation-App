# 🧘‍♂️ Meditation App

A modern, minimal meditation timer built with React + Tailwind CSS to help users focus, relax, and build mindfulness habits.

## 📜 Background

This app was originally created in 2021 as a simple vanilla JavaScript project. In 2024, it was fully rebuilt from scratch using React and Tailwind CSS to reflect modern best practices in front-end development — and to turn a personal idea into a polished, real-world tool.

- 💾 Remembers last session with `localStorage`
- 📱 Fully responsive design for mobile + desktop
